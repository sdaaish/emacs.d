* emacs.d
My universal emacs configuration directory.

Loading /emacs.org/ in emacs and running ~org-babel-tangle~ generates both ~early-init.el~ and ~init.el~. This is based on information from *System Crafters Emacs config, Emacs from scratch*, especially [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/tree/9388cf6ecd9b44c430867a5c3dad5f050fdc0ee1][Configure everything with Org Babel]].

** Linux info
Clone this to a folder, I'm using =~/.config/.emacs.default= nowadays since I also use *Chemacs2*, but default for emacs is =~/.emacs.d= or =~/.config/emacs=.
The code for my linux setup is in [[https://github.com/sdaaish/dotfiles][dotfiles]].
#+begin_src sh
git clone https://github.com/sdaaish/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
#+end_src
** Windows info
To make Emacs work as good as possible make sure to set the *HOME-variable* in Windows. If this doesn't exist Emacs looks in ~$env:AppData\.emacs.d~ for it's configuration files. I have setup ~$env:HOME~ to ~$env:UserProfile~ so that I have the same file strcuture as in Linux. That files is in ~$HOME/config~ in most cases.

Nowadays I use *Chemacs2* also in Windows and therefore I install the config in ~$env:UserProfile\.config\emacs.default~. This setup is described in [[https://github.com/sdaaish/windotfiles][windotfiles]].
*** Powershell
#+begin_src powershell
git clone https://github.com/plexus/chemacs2.git $env:HOME
git clone https://github.com/sdaaish/emacs.d.git $env:HOME/.config/emacs.default
git -C $env:HOME/.config/emacs.default submodule update --init
#+end_src
Edit ~$env:HOME/.emacs-profiles.el for chemacs2~
